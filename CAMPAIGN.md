Zone

Zone into area, camera is on the orb, it can be on an alter, or buried within a pile of gems, or glowing above a small lake, or surrounded by thorny vines, etc.
There are enemies around it, or wandering.  Camera pans down to where the group is going to spawn in.  Portal appears on ground and players emerge.

Fight your way to the gem and retreive it. Zone changes, mood, lighting, (shaders). A boss can spawn, or zone can be collapsing and you need to run out and
avoid mechanics.  Escape with the orb.
